\chapter{Notation}

The following notations are used throughout this thesis
continously, they are mostly adapted from the works
of \cite{Dijkstra1959} and \cite{Karp1972}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Total functions from a domain $X$ to a codomain $Y$ are denoted
  $f:\ X \to Y$, while partial functions are denoted by $g:\ X \leadsto Y$.
  \item The image of a function is denoted
  $f(X) = \set{y \in Y \with \exists\ x \in X:\ f(x) = y} \subseteq Y$.
  \item \ldots
\end{itemize}
