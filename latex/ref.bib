abstract="Research showed that microarchitectural attacks like cache attacks can be performed through websites using JavaScript. These timing attacks allow an adversary to spy on users secrets such as their keystrokes, leveraging fine-grained timers. However, the W3C and browser vendors responded to this significant threat by eliminating fine-grained timers from JavaScript. This renders previous high-resolution microarchitectural attacks non-applicable.",

We give two applications to RSA encryption with exponent 3. First, knowledge of all the ciphertext and 2/3 of the plaintext bits for a single message reveals that message. Second, if messages are padded with truly random padding and then encrypted with an exponent 3, then two encryptions of the same message (with different padding) will reveal the message, as long as the padding is less than 1/9 of the length of N. With several encryptions, another technique can (heuristically) tolerate padding up to about 1/6 of the length of N.",

In the early days of the web, most online access was through a modem and users were charged for the time they spent connected. Opportunists, looking for free online access would literally drive the streets of a town waiting for a wifi signal to become available. If it was insecure – and in those days it frequently was – that ‘drive-by’ or ‘war driving’ approach enabled the perpetrator to get onto the Internet for free.  },

We implement a cache timing attack against the scatter--gather implementation used in the modular exponentiation routine in OpenSSL version 1.0.2f. Our attack exploits cache-bank conflicts on the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture. We have tested the attack on an Intel Xeon E5-2430 processor.
