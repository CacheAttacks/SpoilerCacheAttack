abstract="Research showed that microarchitectural attacks like cache attacks can be performed through websites using JavaScript. These timing attacks allow an adversary to spy on users secrets such as their keystrokes, leveraging fine-grained timers. However, the W3C and browser vendors responded to this significant threat by eliminating fine-grained timers from JavaScript. This renders previous high-resolution microarchitectural attacks non-applicable.",

abstract="We introduce and analyze a side-channel attack on a straight-forward implementation of the RSA key generation step. The attack exploits power information that allows to determine the number of the trial divisions for each prime candidate. Practical experiments are conducted, and countermeasures are proposed. For realistic parameters the success probability of our attack is in the order of 10--15 {\%}.",
