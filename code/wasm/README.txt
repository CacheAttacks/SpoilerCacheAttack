How to start?
You need emscripten to compile c code to a webassembly binary (.wasm).
To install a portable version of emscripten, you can execute the script "install_emscripten_portable.sh" (Windows users could rename the file to "install_emscripten_portable.cmd" and execute it with powershell).
The script will create a folder named "emsdk-portable"(size ~1.3GB) in the current working directory.
To setup the PATH variable you can execute "source WORKINGDIR/emsdk-portable/emsdk_env.sh" or add this command to your .bashrc file. (Test: Execute "emcc" and you should get the error message "WARNING:root:no input files")
Use the script "prime_probe/.vscode/compile.sh" to compile the code in the "prime_probe" folder (The used command line arguments for emcc are described here: https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html).

It is advisable to use the local webserver from emscripten to avoid some browser origin restrictions. To start the webserver with "prime_probe" as the root directory execute "WORKINGDIR/emsdk-portable/emscripten/1.38.11/emrun --no_browser --port 8080 REPOS/code/wasm/prime_probe".
To start the App execute "http://localhost:8080/eviction_set_finder_START_ME.html" in Google Chrome or Firefox. The attack relies on SharedArrayBuffers, therefore make sure your browser configuration supports this feature (for more information read "enable_SAB_browser.txt").

If you want to use R to plot the observed mem accesses install the package plumber via the command "install.packages("plumber")".
Afterwards you should set your working directory with "setwd("REPOS/code/r/prime_probe/")" first.
Now you can start the plumber server with the command "plumber::plumb("plumber.R")$run(port=8000)".
The server is now waiting for incoming requests (in our case from JS).
